          <h3>Hi, I'm Aaron</h3>

          <p>I work as a software engineer in the Halifax area. When I'm not working
          I'm practicing jiujitsu, skateboarding with my dog Alfred, playing guitar,
          working out, snowboarding or learning about electricity and building hardware.</p>

        <p>My latest work project is a pair of apps on iOS that aim to streamline
        the process of renovating a kitchen or a bathroom. Over the last 2 years
        I've worked closely with an Android developer, the clients backend team and
        our web development team. Have a look.</p>

        <p>Outside of work I'm building an app to track my nutrition. I have all
        kinds of ideas where to take it but for now I just want to replace the
        cronometer as my nutrition tracking software. Check it out.</p>

        <p>At the same time I'm in the process of building a Primer Cube. The
        primer cube is something I came across online that I said to possess
        healing powers. It looks interesting to me. You can see my progress here.</p>

        <p>Jiujitsu is something that I really enjoy. Jiujitsu actually the gentle
        art and it does have the capacity to be gentle as a self defense style. But
        it's contact sport. I train 4-6 times a week and it motivates me to eat well
        and workout.</p>

        <p>I'm a dog person. My best buddy Ollie went to the next place Feb 2022.
        I can't remember being so sad. But he told me he was coming back and his
        grandson Alfred arrived in April of 2022.</p>
